### Downloading

Clone the repository like so,

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jordanbrauer/udacity-fend-web-optimization.git
```

### Installing

Next install the project with a simple

```shell
$ npm install
```

In addition to downloading the project dependencies like normal, this command also invokes the `postinstall` npm script after dependencies have been downloaded. The `postinstall` script runs the `compile:static-content` and `compile:di` gulp commands, more on these in the API section.

### API Usage

The API is written in JS and uses Gulp. See the docs [here](https://jordanbrauer.github.io/udacity-fend-web-optimization/docs/).
